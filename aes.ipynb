    "\n",
    "Well, if our key *exactly matches* the length of of what we're encrypting, the attacker has no way to efficiently guess the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because:\n",
    "- No parts of the key are repeating, its completely random and would need to be derived from scratch\n",
    "- The crypto text has absolutely *zero* information, if the cypher is random, so is the encrypted text. (equal chance of zero and one for each)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The more times the key is repeated, the more words they'll be able to construct, and if the key repeats a *huge* number of times:\n",
    "- the attacker is able to construct small words with 24 bits (2^24 options only), and the key which makes common words repeat the most is correct\n",
