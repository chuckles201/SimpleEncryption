# Cryptography! Repo (AES CTR)

This is my first forray into encryption!

Specifically, my goals for this repo, are learning:

- How does file encryption work (modern standards understand, w/background), specifically key-based. And why was this chosen/what is special and good about AES?
- How to implement this for large-files in an optimized, memory-efficient way (learning efficient i/o with c)
