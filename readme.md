# Encryption Repo

This is my first forray into encryption!

Specifically, my goals for this repo, are learning:

- How does file encryption work (modern standards understand, w/background), specifically key-based
- How do we safely access, work with encrypted data (ie a company with csv of customer data), so that it is never 'leaked' to disk in unencrypted form --> How file reading/writing works

I'd like to work mostly in the C language, in order to understand the low-level read/writes that are happening, and have more understanding of the memory and effeciency that we want to have.
